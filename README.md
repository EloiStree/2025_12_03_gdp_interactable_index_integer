With a bit of abstraction, this makes it possible to connect an IID interaction simply by assigning a tag and a parent.

“Manually wiring every button to an event that sends an integer is incredibly tedious when you’re dealing with hundreds of them.
It’s far easier to just drag and drop a tag into the node and let a parent handle the rest.
*And in some cases, you only need to attach a small script to a single button to do the job.*

Below is a script that emits either an integer or an integer paired with its index value, ready to be used with other IID tools.”


```
git submodule add https://github.com/EloiStree/2025_12_03_gdp_interactable_index_integer.git addons/2025_12_03_gdp_interactable_index_integer
git submodule update --init --recursive

```
